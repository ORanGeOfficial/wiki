Besides of [TerraFirmaCraft](http://wiki.terrafirmacraft.com/Main_Page) original spawner of [Ore and Minerals](http://wiki.terrafirmacraft.com/Ores_%26_Minerals), additional ores and minerals are generated:  

bauxite, bischofite, chromite, gyubnera, stibnite, pyrolusite, spodumene, xenotime, monazite (metal ores),  
apatite, datolite, limestone, feldspar, trona, salmiac, fluorite, prismarine (minerals) and crude oil.  

Additionally new stone veins are generated: peridotite and pegmatite, which are a matrix for generation some rare deposits.  

Most of ores and minerals can be scanned both with use of prospector pick or IC2 ore scanners.  Ore scanner gives also response from magmatic and metamorphic rocks including gemstone occurrence, however it is not sensitive on soft layers such sedimentary rocks or crude oil deposits.  

**Comprehensive list of additional ores, their spawn occurrences and detection methods, can be [found here.](https://github.com/McZapkie/TerraFirmaProgressivePack/blob/master/doc/ores.pdf)**

Many ores have two possible occurrences: major in matrix rock (for example stibnite i basalt) and additional minor deposits (for example stibnite in hydrotermal veins, salmiac in lava veins, limestone under river bed, trona under lake bed etc).
Hydrotermal veins with additional minerals can be found only under deep ocean bed.
