## Processing paths chart
There is **[chart with some important processing paths](https://github.com/McZapkie/TerraFirmaProgressivePack/blob/master/doc/processingpaths.pdf)**, including flux, leather, mortar, efficient iron and steel production, zinc plating with cadmium recovery, aluminum smelting and some basic chemical components (natrium hydroxide, sulfuric, nitric and hydrochloric acid).  

For another processing paths please refer NEI readings.  

I advise to use some in-game manuals (Achievements book, IE manual, IFL manual).  

## Below there are some hints.  

### Usage of iron workbench.

Iron workbench have three slot groups: shapeles input of tools, shapeless input of materials and multiple slots for output. Therefore you can put additional tools and materials and choose output, unused materials will remain on the table.  
Below there is example: the only material required for piston is hot steel ingot, additional stick is not needed but doesn't interfere with recipe and will remain intact. Most of tools also is not needed and only lathe will be used and slightly damaged:

Left border of GUI, belo iron workbench icon, contain requirements for additional machines, in above case it is lathe table. Additional machines must to be placed close to workbench. In case of lathe table, both parts must be placed, see picture below:
![lathe placement](https://github.com/McZapkie/TerraFirmaProgressivePack/blob/master/doc/ironworkbench_latheplacement.png)

Some of machines need to be powered and have electric motor in its slot. Welding station must to be filled with oxygen (left bottle) and water with carbide (right bottle).  

### Efficient steel production.  

Transfer ladle, filled with ore batch and flux, must to be placed into IE blast furnace:
![Immersive Engineering blast furnace](https://github.com/McZapkie/TerraFirmaProgressivePack/blob/master/doc/improvedblastfurnace.png)

This will produce transfer ladle filled with liquid pig iron. The next step is Bessemer Blast Furnace, which need heat source and compressed air to convert pig iron into liquid steel:
![Bessemer convertor](https://github.com/McZapkie/TerraFirmaProgressivePack/blob/master/doc/bessemerfurnace.png)

Transfer ladle block should be placed 4 tiles above refractory hopper (funnel for hot liquids) which will catch molten steel and transport it to Caster or other Foundry device.  
It is vise to make 5 block high chimney above refractory hopper:
![Proper ladle placement](https://github.com/McZapkie/TerraFirmaProgressivePack/blob/master/doc/transferladle1.png)

Use pickaxe to skip liquid metal from transfer ladle down to funnel.  
Important note: ladle is always skipped in north direction:
![one side of shimney is transparent for better view](https://github.com/McZapkie/TerraFirmaProgressivePack/blob/master/doc/transferladle2.png)

If everything is OK, you should see metal caster slowly filled with liquid steel:
![metal caster gui](https://github.com/McZapkie/TerraFirmaProgressivePack/blob/master/doc/filledcaster.png).  

One transfer ladle contain 5000 mb of liquid steel, equivalent of about 40 ingots.  
If metal caster and hopper are empty, probably transfer ladle was placed too high. Place additional hopper above to solve problem.
