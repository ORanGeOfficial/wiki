For compatibility reasons (cuchaz ships mod work best with 'vanilla' blocks, chiseled/detailed TFCs blocks and TFC containers should not be used for building ship) number of blocks accepted for building ship is limited.
Following blocks can be used for building ship and have positive buoyancy:
* logs and planks blocks impregnated in olive oil
* planks blocks made from creozote impregnated planks
* rubber wood logs
* pile of TFC logs
* thatch (straw blocks)

Standard chest (made from TFC chest and black steel L-beams) can be used on ship, as well as animal crates.
For other blocks please refer to config/shipBlockProperties.cfg file, second true/false switch need to be set 'false' to accept block for ship assembly.

Wool block, fences, vertical support beams, trapdoors etc are accepted for ship assembly, but are not 'waterproof' (ship would sink if they are used to make ship side/bottom).

Please note, that thatch and logs pile cannot be placed adjacent to water.
Below there is example, how to assembly simple raft: first make wooden platform, place thatch on it, remove platform - raft is ready to launch.
