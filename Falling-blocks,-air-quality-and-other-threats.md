* Most of blocks have physics enabled, they will fall if not supported or support too long.
Cheap blocks (for example cobblestone walls) have short maximal support, expensive blocks (treated wood, stone bricks) have larger maximal support, advanced blocks (for example reinforced construction foam) are not affected by physics.
* Air quality depletes in enclosed rooms/caves/mines in presence of lava/fire source/torches/machines etc. Use shaft/chimney to the open sky or protect yourself using respirator. Tree saplings/leaves placed nearby also helps.
* Mind sanity affected by mobs can be improved by alcoholic beverages or lemonade.
* Night sky light depend on moon phase. Torches can provide portable/throwable light source. For mining, Hard Hat is recommended (glass dust needed for making light globe can be dropped from broken glass).
