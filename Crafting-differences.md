* There is early game alternative for limewater used for leather preparation: base liquor from ashes
* There is alternative for limemilk used for mortar production: gypsum plaster
* Calcium carbonate rocks need to be calcinated in firepit/forge or furnace to produce quicklime, which work as flux
* Barrels are harder to construct, need hoops (either from hot water treated wood, forged metal or rolled aluminum)
* Most crafting recipes have construction beams and rivets used instead of ingots and nuggets.
* Sand heated in Firepit produce only dirt stained glass. Clear glass can be produced in furnace and foundry.
* Glass panes need rolled tin plate used as mold. 
* Glass bottles need to be forged from hot glass with use of hot tuyere, alternatively gas welding station and blowing pipe.
* IC2 refined iron is renamed to 'stainless steel' and is alloy of steel and chrome (or ferrochrome).
* IC2 blast furnace is renamed to Bessemer furnace and is used to refine liquid pig iron into liquid steel.
* Immersive Engineering blast furnace is used to produce liquid pig iron.
* Refer to [processing hints](https://github.com/McZapkie/TerraFirmaProgressivePack/wiki/Processing-paths-and-hints) for detailed information how to skip transfer ladle content to Foundry metal caster.
* Railcraft blast furnace is used only to produce liquid iron
