## Some most important crafting differences, all others see NEI.

* Use upper (for device) and lower (for recipe) **NEI arrows < > to check any alternatives**.
* There is early game alternative for limewater used for leather preparation: base liquor from ashes.
* There is alternative for limemilk used for mortar production: gypsum plaster.
* Calcium carbonate rocks need to be crushed/grinded and calcinated in firepit/forge or furnace to produce quicklime, which can be converted to **flux**. In later stage, 'vanilla' furnace can be used for fast flux production.
* **Barrels** are harder to construct, need hoops (either from hot water treated wood, forged metal or rolled aluminum)
* Most crafting recipes have construction beams and rivets used instead of ingots and nuggets.
* Sand heated in Firepit produce only dirt stained glass. **Clear glass** can be produced in furnace or foundry. Quartz glass can be produced only in foundry caster.
* Glass panes need rolled tin plate used as a mold. 
* **Glass bottles** need to be forged from hot glass with use of hot tuyere, alternatively gas welding station and blowing pipe.
* **Quartzite sand** can be separated by sieve or washer from granite or gneiss sand, with some feldspar as a by-product.
* IC2 refined iron is renamed to 'stainless steel' and is alloy of steel and chrome (or ferrochrome).
* IC2 blast furnace is renamed to Bessemer furnace and is used to refine liquid pig iron into liquid steel.
* Immersive Engineering blast furnace is used to produce liquid pig iron.
* Refer to [processing hints](https://github.com/McZapkie/TerraFirmaProgressivePack/wiki/Processing-paths-and-hints) for detailed information how to skip transfer ladle content to Foundry metal caster.
* Railcraft blast furnace is used only to produce liquid iron.
* Yellow coke oven produce more creosote oil than gray one, but on slower rate.
* Tier 0 ship block and paddle can be produced at stone age stage, sailing ship control blocks need more progression. Thatch blocks can be used to improve raft buoyancy.
* Only impregnated wood (oil impregnated logs and planks, creosote treated planks and raw rubber logs) can be used for **ship construction**.
* There are two methods of **paper** production: macerating reeds in base liquor and using wooden press (must be exposed tu sun and broken when dried), or advanced chemical processing wooden flour with sodium sulfide as input for paper machine.
* Latex resin can be obtained with resin collecting sack, which should be mounted at rubber tree slot.
* Redstone is a result of grinding chipped or flawed red gems (tourmaline, topaz, ruby etc). In later stage you can melt large gems or produce synthetic redstone.
