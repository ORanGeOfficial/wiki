## Mob spawning
Unlike vanilla TFC, aggresive mobs usually appear underground (skeletons, poisonous spiders, zombies, slimes and blazes), or very high (spiders), except weekly raids of zombie and skeletons (depend on moon phase).  

At the surface there are usually relatively peaceful (if not provoked) creatures, such zombie pigmans or endermans.
Additionally, if is raining, some silverfish can be spotted on the sand beach. Night stormy weather in the middle of deep ocean can also summon some ghasts.   

Ozelots can be found is swamp biome.  Can be tamed by using cat food (fish cooked in standard furnace).

## Mob properties
Some underground zombies are faster than regular ones.  
Members of weekly raids, Zombie Warriors, are equipped with chain mall and bronze mace, are hard to defeat and can inflicts serious damages. Zombie Green Warriors, equipped with bismuth bronze armour and halberd, are even more dangerous than previous ones.

## Mob drops
If killed with fire, zombies and skeletons would not drop anything but block of dirt/clay/gravel/cobblestone, or just set fire. Creeper also is not dropping anything if killed by fire, it would explode instead.  
Bear, enderman, wailer, armoured zombies and pigmans have small chance of dropping gun shader bags. Be aware, that there is small chance of spawning wailer, when enderman is killed.   
Blaze will not drop anything if killed with water.  
Underground zombies are divided into few different "jobs", for example farmer zombie can drop industrial hemps or jute seeds, zombie messenger can drop paper or engineering blueprints, others can drop some ores, wood or lanterns.  
Ghasts, beside standard drop, can also give prismarine shards.

## Block properties and drops
Radioactive containment enclosed in box and seasoned in barrel, can give some additional items (transmuted plates or metal dust piles, mutated rare seeds or saplings, spawning eggs) or even spawn some creatures (silverfish, cave spider, chicken, slime, creeper or blaze).  
There is only 30% chance, that pumpkin would be harvested successfully, whereas lit pumpkin will be always destroyed completely upon break.  
Peridotite and pegmatite can drop some extra ores or gems.
Glass and quartzite glass can drop glass dust (which can be melted again) if broken. Glass in no more fire resistant. Use reinforced glass or quartz glass to hold lava/fire.
